Transformer for Language Translation
This repository contains an implementation of a Transformer model for language translation tasks, inspired by the paper "Attention is All You Need" by Vaswani et al. The Transformer model is a state-of-the-art architecture that has shown great success in various natural language processing tasks, including machine translation.

Features
Transformer model for language translation
Self-attention mechanism for capturing global dependencies
Multi-head attention for attending to different information types simultaneously
Positional encoding for incorporating sequence order information
Feed-forward neural network for non-linear transformations
Layer normalization for improved training stability
Beam search for generating translations
Requirements
Python 3.6 or higher
PyTorch 1.8.0 or higher
NumPy 1.19.5 or higher
